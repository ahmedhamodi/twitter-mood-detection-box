So, we were trying to figure out how to make API calls from the arduino. 
We now have a way for that as long as its connected to the internet.

The resource above is from the official arduino site. Should help us get the ball rolling. 

Then came the question of parsing what we get: JSON. Didn't know that this was initially.
Got acquainted with it through these sites:
	http://www.json.org
	http://hardwarefun.com/tutorials/parsing-json-in-arduino
	https://bblanchon.github.io/ArduinoJson/doc/decoding/

The first one is an intro to JSON and the last two are "tutorials" on how to decode them. 

This is part of the evolutionary prototype, aimed at exposing us to what we're going to be working with.
